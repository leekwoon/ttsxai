       " 'LJ001-0091': 'so far as fine printing is concerned, though paper did not get to its worst till about eighteen forty.',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0098': 'and the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the letters.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0099': 'It must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press,',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0104': 'Italy is contentedly stagnant.',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0107': 'To say a few words on the principles of design in typography:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0108': 'it is obvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed at in the forms of the letters;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0109': 'this is best furthered by the avoidance of irrational swellings and spiky projections, and by the using of careful purity of line.',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0114': 'an ugly pear-shaped swelling defacing the form of the letter:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0115': 'in short, it happens to this craft, as to others, that the utilitarian practice, though it professes to avoid ornament,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0116': 'still clings to a foolish, because misunderstood conventionality, deduced from what was once ornament, and is by no means useful;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0117': 'which title can only be claimed by artistic practice, whether the art in it be conscious or unconscious.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0118': 'In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar illegibility of the modern type',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0119': 'and the elegance and legibility of the ancient more striking than in the Arabic numerals.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0120': 'In the old print each figure has its definite individuality, and one cannot be mistaken for the other;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0121': 'in reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can have any reasonable assurance',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0122': 'that he has a five, an eight, or a three before him, unless the press work is of the best:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0123': \"this is awkward if you have to read Bradshaw's Guide in a hurry.\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0124': 'One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0125': 'this is the narrowing of the modern letters.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0126': \"Most of Jenson's letters are designed within a square,\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0127': 'the modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout; but while this gain of space very much hampers the possibility of beauty of design,',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0129': 'the lateral compression of his letters renders necessary.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0130': 'Commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0131': 'the size known as \"Long primer\" ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be read.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0132': 'Here, again, if the practice of \"leading\" were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0133': 'One very important matter in \"setting up\" for fine printing is the \"spacing,\" that is, the lateral distance of words from one another.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0134': 'In good printing the spaces between the words should be as near as possible equal',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0135': 'it is impossible that they should be quite equal except in lines of poetry',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0136': 'modern printers understand this, but it is only practiced in the very best establishments.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0137': 'But another point which they should attend to they almost always disregard;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0138': 'this is the tendency to the formation of ugly meandering white lines or \"rivers\" in the page',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0140': 'the desirable thing being \"the breaking of the line\" as in bonding masonry or brickwork',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0141': 'The general solidity of a page is much to be sought for',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0144': 'the words may be set much closer together, without loss of clearness.',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0147': 'The position of the page on the paper should be considered if the book is to have a satisfactory look.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0148': 'Here once more the almost invariable modern practice is in opposition to a natural sense of proportion.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0149': 'From the time when books first took their present shape till the end of the sixteenth century, or indeed later,',\n",
